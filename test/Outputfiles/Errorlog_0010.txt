 AIOMFAC WARNING 10: Temperature range related.
 At least one data point has a set temperature outside of
 the recommended range for model calculations of 
 electrolyte-containing mixtures. This may be intended, 
 but caution is advised as AIOMFAC is not designed to  
 perform well at this temperature.
 Data point no.:            1

 =======================================================
 AIOMFAC ERROR 6: Numerical issue.
 A numerical issue occurred during computation of the
 data points flagged in the output tables.
 This error was possibly caused due to input of very
 high electrolyte concentrations.
 Composition point no.:            1
